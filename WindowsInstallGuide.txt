Install Node.js 18 on your machine by downloading and running the installer from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Download the MongoDB Community Server from the official MongoDB website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Run the installer and choose the Complete setup type to install all of the components.

During the installation, choose the Custom installation option to specify the installation directory and to install MongoDB as a service. The default installation directory is C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4.

After the installation, create a data directory where MongoDB will store its data. The default data directory is C:\data\db. If you want to use a different directory, create it and make sure that it has the appropriate permissions for MongoDB to read and write data to it.

Add the MongoDB binaries to your system's PATH environment variable. To do this, follow these steps:

Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
Under "System Variables", find the "Path" variable and click on "Edit".
Click on "New" and add the path to the MongoDB binaries, which is typically "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin".
Click "OK" to close all windows.
Clone the Github repository for the Main Service onto your local machine by running the following command in your terminal: git clone <repository URL>

Navigate to the cloned repository's directory in your terminal by running the following command: cd <repository directory>

Create a new file called .env in the root directory of the cloned repository by running the following command: type nul > .env

Copy the contents of the .env.template file provided in the repository, and paste them into the new .env file by running the following command: copy .env.template .env

Fill in the variables in the .env file with your own definitions. For example, you can open the .env file in a text editor and set the DATABASE_URL variable to the URL for your MongoDB instance. The default value is mongodb://localhost:27017/registration_system.

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal: npm i

Generate a data layer SDK based on the schema file defined in prisma/schema.prisma and push the schema changes to the database by running the following command in your terminal: npm run gen

To run the development server, run the following command in your terminal: npm run dev

To run the production server, first build the source files by running the following command in your terminal: npm run build, then run the following command to start the server: npm run start.
